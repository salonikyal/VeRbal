A game with a Virtual Reality view for children to learn lingustic skills made using Unity. <br>

This game works as an auditory and visual stimulus to improve children's linguistic ability. The game can also be monitored by caretakers or parents via a desktop interface. It has two main parts:<br>
1. **Android application:** A mobile VR game which creates an engaging study experience for children by incorporating a mobile device, cardboard glasses, and an audio headset. Child can hear and read the sentence on the screen and select the matching 3-D model by gazing at it for atleast 3 seconds. The game has 2 modes:<br>
* Training Mode: This mode is to train the children and help them learn the game by providing feedbacks to the child for correct and incorrect answers. A beautiful story is narrated during the entire training process.<br>

2. **Website:** The website can be used by caretakers or parents to visualize and control the VR game in order to assess and monitor the children. The live data on the mobile VR game can be seen by them and the relevant monitoring data recieved from the servers is also monitored. They have full access to start/stop the game.
